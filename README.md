## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The RAG pipeline consists of two main components:

1. **Retrieval Module:**
   - **Embedding Generation:** Uses the `SentenceTransformer` model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert text chunks into numerical embeddings.
   - **Indexing with FAISS:** Stores embeddings in a FAISS index to enable fast similarity searches.
   - **Query Processing:** Transforms user queries into embeddings and retrieves the top-K most similar text chunks from the index.

2. **Generation Module:**
   - **Language Model:** Utilizes the `T5` model (`t5-base`) to generate coherent and contextually relevant answers based on the retrieved text chunks.
   - **Answer Generation:** Combines the user query with the retrieved context to produce concise summaries or responses.

## üìà Results

### **Performance Metrics:**

- **Embedding Generation:** Efficiently generated embeddings for 100 ArXiv papers with GPU acceleration.
- **Retrieval Speed:** Achieved retrieval of top-5 relevant chunks in under 0.1 seconds per query.

### **Sample Output:**

**Q) What is machine learning?**

**A) the process in which computers learn to make decisions based on the given data set**


## üìÖ Future Work

- **Expand Data Sources:** Integrate additional academic repositories like IEEE Xplore and SpringerLink to broaden the knowledge base.
- **Advanced Retrieval Techniques:** Implement hybrid retrieval methods combining dense embeddings with traditional keyword-based searches for enhanced accuracy.
- **Enhanced Generation Models:** Experiment with larger models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 to further improve answer quality.
- **Topic Modeling and Citation Analysis:** Add features to categorize documents by topic and analyze citation networks for deeper insights.
- **User Personalization:** Develop personalized recommendations based on user preferences and interaction history.
